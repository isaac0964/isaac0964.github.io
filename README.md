## Work Experience 

**Innovation and Enrepeneurship Manager @ University of Guanajuato (_Feb 2023 - July 2023_)**
-  Conducted data analysis on student entrepreneurship initiatives to uncover behavioral and performance
trends, informing decisions on program design and resource allocation within the Innovation Lab.

- Led innovation and entrepreneurship initiatives, supporting the development of students and fostering a
culture of innovation within the organization.

- Organized workshops, mentorship programs, and innovation challenges to empower entrepreneurs and early-
stage projects.

**Research Assistant @ Forte Innovation Consulting (_Aug 2022 - Feb 2023_)**
- Implemented text mining for information extraction from CVs: Developed a pipeline to extract structured
data (name, skills, experience, education) from resumes in PDF format. Applied techniques such as preproc-
cesing and regular expressions, improving recruitment efficiency through automated candidate pre-screening.

- Applied statistical models (e.g., clustering, classification) on extracted CV data to group candidates and
support automated profiling and decision-making.

## Projects

### Improving moving insect detection with difference of features maps in YOLO architecure

Introduced the motion module, a lightweight component designed to enhance object detection by integrating motion information directly at the feature map level within the YOLOv8 backbone. Unlike methods that rely on frame differencing and require additional preprocessing steps, our approach operates on raw input and uses only two consecutive frames. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that incorporating the motion module leads to consistent performance improvements across key object detection metrics.

### MobileNetv2 for Crop Pest Classification 
This project leverages MobileNetv2, a lightweight convolutional neural network, to classify images of crop pests efficiently. Designed for deployment in resource-constrained environments, the model enables accurate pest identification directly from field images, aiding early pest detection and supporting sustainable agricultural practices.

### Training Neural Network with Kalman for PID Controller

This project explores the integration of a neural network trained to assist traditional PID control, enhanced with a Kalman filter for state estimation. The controller is applied to a TurtleBot, aiming for smooth and accurate navigation by learning dynamic responses and reducing sensor noise through Kalman filtering. This hybrid approach improves control precision in real-time robotic tasks.

### Training Neural Network using Genetic Algorithms

This project explores the use of genetic algorithms to train neural networks by evolving their weights over generations. Instead of traditional gradient-based optimization, a population of candidate solutions is evaluated and evolved using selection, crossover, and mutation, aiming to find optimal or near-optimal network parameters.
