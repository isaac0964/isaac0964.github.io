## Work Experience 

**Innovation and Enrepeneurship Manager @ University of Guanajuato (_Feb 2023 - July 2023_)**
-  Conducted data analysis on student entrepreneurship initiatives to uncover behavioral and performance
trends, informing decisions on program design and resource allocation within the Innovation Lab.

- Led innovation and entrepreneurship initiatives, supporting the development of students and fostering a
culture of innovation within the organization.

- Organized workshops, mentorship programs, and innovation challenges to empower entrepreneurs and early-
stage projects.

**Research Assistant @ Forte Innovation Consulting (_Aug 2022 - Feb 2023_)**
- Implemented text mining for information extraction from CVs: Developed a pipeline to extract structured
data (name, skills, experience, education) from resumes in PDF format. Applied techniques such as preproc-
cesing and regular expressions, improving recruitment efficiency through automated candidate pre-screening.

- Applied statistical models (e.g., clustering, classification) on extracted CV data to group candidates and
support automated profiling and decision-making.

## Projects

### Using MobileNetv2 for Crop Pest Classification 
This project leverages MobileNetv2, a lightweight convolutional neural network, to classify images of crop pests efficiently. Designed for deployment in resource-constrained environments, the model enables accurate pest identification directly from field images, aiding early pest detection and supporting sustainable agricultural practices.
